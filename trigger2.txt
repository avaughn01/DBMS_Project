Below is the trigger:

DELIMITER $$

CREATE TRIGGER add_contract
AFTER INSERT ON maint_heat_ac
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
INSERT INTO `contractor` (`contract_ID`, `company_name`, `address`, `phone`) VALUES
(NEW.contract_ID, 'Temp Name', 'Temp Address', 000000);
END $$

Inserting the data into main_heat_ac produces an error for the contractor table since a contract_ID of 1 is already present, so it does not get added to contractor, but the data still gets added to maint_heat_ac

INSERT INTO `maint_heat_ac` (`company_ID`, `contract_ID`, `heat_name`) VALUES
(150, 1, 'New Guy');

Inserting this data produces no errors, and adds an extra entry into contractor with some temp values as placeholders.

INSERT INTO `maint_heat_ac` (`company_ID`, `contract_ID`, `heat_name`) VALUES
(160, 3, 'Newer Guy');
